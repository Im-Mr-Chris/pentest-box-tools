##Web Vulnerability Scanners

* [Burp Suite](http://portswigger.net/burp/) - Burp Suite is an integrated platform for performing security testing of web applications. Its various tools work seamlessly together to support the entire testing process, from initial mapping and analysis of an application's attack surface, through to finding and exploiting security vulnerabilities.
* [deblaze](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/deblaze) - This tool will allow you to perform method enumeration and interrogation
against flash remoting end points.  Deblaze came about as a necessity during a few security assessments of flash based websites that made heavy use of flash remoting.
* [fimap](https://tha-imax.de/git/root/fimap/tree/master) - fimap is a little python tool which can find, prepare, audit, exploit and even google automaticly for local and remote file inclusion bugs in webapps. fimap should be something like sqlmap just for LFI/RFI bugs instead of sql injection. It's currently under heavy development but it's usable.
* [Grabber](http://rgaucher.info/beta/grabber/) - Grabber is a web application scanner. Basically it detects some kind of vulnerabilities	in your website. Grabber is simple, not fast but portable and really adaptable. This software is designed to scan small websites such as personals, forums etc. absolutely not big application: it would take too long time and flood your network.
* [jSQL](https://github.com/ron190/jsql-injection) - jSQL Injection is a lightweight application used to find database information from a distant server. jSQL is free, open source and cross-platform (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris).
* [Joomscan](http://sourceforge.net/projects/joomscan/) - Detects file inclusion, sql injection, command execution vulnerabilities of a target Joomla! web site.
* [Nikto](https://github.com/sullo/nikto) - Nikto is an Open Source (GPL) web server scanner which performs comprehensive tests against web servers for multiple items, including over 6700 potentially dangerous files/programs, checks for outdated versions of over 1250 servers, and version specific problems on over 270 servers.
* [PadBuster](https://github.com/GDSSecurity/PadBuster) - Automated script for performing Padding Oracle attacks
* [SqlMap](http://sqlmap.org/) - sqlmap is an open source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws and taking over of database servers. It comes with a powerful detection engine, many niche features for the ultimate penetration tester and a broad range of switches lasting from database fingerprinting, over data fetching from the database, to accessing the underlying file system and executing commands on the operating system via out-of-band connections.
* [Uniscan](http://sourceforge.net/projects/uniscan/) - Uniscan is a simple Remote File Include, Local File Include and Remote Command Execution vulnerability scanner.
* [Vega](https://subgraph.com/vega/) - Vega is a free and open source scanner and testing platform to test the security of web applications. Vega can help you find and validate SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), inadvertently disclosed sensitive information, and other vulnerabilities. It is written in Java, GUI based, and runs on Linux, OS X, and Windows.


#Password Attacks

* [Burp Suite](http://portswigger.net/burp/) - Burp Suite is an integrated platform for performing security testing of web applications. Its various tools work seamlessly together to support the entire testing process, from initial mapping and analysis of an application's attack surface, through to finding and exploiting security vulnerabilities.
* [Cewl](http://www.digininja.org/projects/cewl.php) - CeWL is a ruby app which spiders a given url to a specified depth, optionally following external links, and returns a list of words which can then be used for password crackers such as John the Ripper.
* [CredDump](https://github.com/moyix/creddump) - creddump is a python tool to extract various credentials and secrets from
Windows registry hives. It currently extracts:
  * LM and NT hashes (SYSKEY protected)
  * Cached domain passwords
  * LSA secrets
* [CryptoHaze](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cryptohaze/) - A CUDA & OpenCL accelerated rainbow table implementation from the ground up, and a CUDA hash brute forcing tool with support for many hash types including MD5, SHA1, LM, NTLM, and lots more!
* [Findmyhash](https://code.google.com/p/findmyhash/) - findmyhash.py try to crack different types of hashes using free online services.
* [HashIdentifier](http://code.google.com/p/hash-identifier/) - Software to identify the different types of hashes used to encrypt data and especially passwords.
* [John the Ripper](http://www.openwall.com/john/) - John the Ripper is a fast password cracker, currently available for many flavors of Unix, Windows, DOS, BeOS, and OpenVMS. Its primary purpose is to detect weak Unix passwords. Besides several crypt(3) password hash types most commonly found on various Unix systems, supported out of the box are Windows LM hashes, plus lots of other hashes and ciphers in the community-enhanced version.
* [keimpx](https://github.com/inquisb/keimpx) - Check for valid credentials across a network over SMB 
* [Patator](https://github.com/lanjelot/patator) - Patator was written out of frustration from using Hydra, Medusa, Ncrack, Metasploit modules and Nmap NSE scripts for password guessing attacks. I opted for a different approach in order to not create yet another brute-forcing tool and avoid repeating the same shortcomings. Patator is a multi-threaded tool written in Python, that strives to be more reliable and flexible than his fellow predecessors.
* [RainbowCrack](http://project-rainbowcrack.com/) - A brute force hash cracker generate all possible plaintexts and compute the corresponding hashes on the fly, then compare the hashes with the hash to be cracked. Once a match is found, the plaintext is found. If all possible plaintexts are tested and no match is found, the plaintext is not found. With this type of hash cracking, all intermediate computation results are discarded.
* [THC Hydra](http://freeworld.thc.org/thc-hydra/) - Hydra is a parallelized login cracker which supports numerous protocols to attack. It is very fast and flexible, and new modules are easy to add. This tool makes it possible for researchers and security consultants to show how easy it would be to gain unauthorized access to a system remotely.

# Post Exploitation

* [Intersect 2.5](https://github.com/deadbits/Intersect-2.5) - Post-Exploitation Framework
* [Weevely](https://github.com/epinna/weevely3) - Weevely is a command line web shell dynamically extended over the network at runtime used for remote administration and pen testing. It provides a weaponized telnet-like console through a PHP script running on the target, even in restricted environments.

# Stress Testing Tools

* [DHCPig](https://github.com/kamorin/DHCPig) - DHCPig initiates an advanced DHCP exhaustion attack. It will consume all IPs on the LAN, stop new users from obtaining IPs, release any IPs in use, then for good measure send gratuitous ARP and knock all windows hosts offline.
* [Terminenter](https://github.com/securestate/termineter) - Termineter is a framework written in python to provide a platform for the security testing of smart meters. It implements the C12.18 and C12.19 protocols for communication. Currently supported are Meters using C12.19 with 7-bit character sets. Termineter communicates with Smart Meters via a connection using an ANSI type-2 optical probe with a serial interface.
* [THC-SSL-DOS](http://www.thc.org/thc-ssl-dos/) - THC-SSL-DOS is a tool to verify the performance of SSL. Establishing a secure SSL connection requires 15x more processing power on the server than on the client. THC-SSL-DOS exploits this asymmetric property by overloading the server and knocking it off the Internet. This problem affects all SSL implementations today. The vendors are aware of this problem since 2003 and the topic has been widely discussed. This attack further exploits the SSL secure Renegotiation feature to trigger thousands of renegotiations via single TCP connection.

#Forensic Tools

*[BinWalk](https://github.com/devttys0/binwalk) - Binwalk is a fast, easy to use tool for analyzing, reverse engineering, and extracting firmware images.
* [Bulk-Extractor](https://github.com/simsong/bulk_extractor/) - bulk_extractor is a program that extracts features such as email addresses, credit card numbers, URLs, and other types of information from digital evidence files. It is a useful forensic investigation tool for many tasks such as malware and intrusion investigations, identity investigations and cyber investigations, as well as analyzing imagery and pass-word cracking
* [Cuckoo Sandbox](https://github.com/cuckoobox/cuckoo) - Cuckoo Sandbox is an automated dynamic malware analysis system
