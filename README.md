##Web Vulnerability Scanners

* [Burp Suite](http://portswigger.net/burp/) - Burp Suite is an integrated platform for performing security testing of web applications. Its various tools work seamlessly together to support the entire testing process, from initial mapping and analysis of an application's attack surface, through to finding and exploiting security vulnerabilities.
* [deblaze](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/deblaze) - This tool will allow you to perform method enumeration and interrogation
against flash remoting end points.  Deblaze came about as a necessity during a few security assessments of flash based websites that made heavy use of flash remoting.
* [fimap](https://tha-imax.de/git/root/fimap/tree/master) - fimap is a little python tool which can find, prepare, audit, exploit and even google automaticly for local and remote file inclusion bugs in webapps. fimap should be something like sqlmap just for LFI/RFI bugs instead of sql injection. It's currently under heavy development but it's usable.
* [Grabber](http://rgaucher.info/beta/grabber/) - Grabber is a web application scanner. Basically it detects some kind of vulnerabilities	in your website. Grabber is simple, not fast but portable and really adaptable. This software is designed to scan small websites such as personals, forums etc. absolutely not big application: it would take too long time and flood your network.
* [jSQL](https://github.com/ron190/jsql-injection) - jSQL Injection is a lightweight application used to find database information from a distant server. jSQL is free, open source and cross-platform (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris).
* [Joomscan](http://sourceforge.net/projects/joomscan/) - Detects file inclusion, sql injection, command execution vulnerabilities of a target Joomla! web site.
* [Nikto](https://github.com/sullo/nikto) - Nikto is an Open Source (GPL) web server scanner which performs comprehensive tests against web servers for multiple items, including over 6700 potentially dangerous files/programs, checks for outdated versions of over 1250 servers, and version specific problems on over 270 servers.
* [PadBuster](https://github.com/GDSSecurity/PadBuster) - Automated script for performing Padding Oracle attacks
* [SqlMap](http://sqlmap.org/) - sqlmap is an open source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws and taking over of database servers. It comes with a powerful detection engine, many niche features for the ultimate penetration tester and a broad range of switches lasting from database fingerprinting, over data fetching from the database, to accessing the underlying file system and executing commands on the operating system via out-of-band connections.
* [Uniscan](http://sourceforge.net/projects/uniscan/) - Uniscan is a simple Remote File Include, Local File Include and Remote Command Execution vulnerability scanner.
* [Vega](https://subgraph.com/vega/) - Vega is a free and open source scanner and testing platform to test the security of web applications. Vega can help you find and validate SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), inadvertently disclosed sensitive information, and other vulnerabilities. It is written in Java, GUI based, and runs on Linux, OS X, and Windows.
