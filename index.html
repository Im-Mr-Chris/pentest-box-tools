        <p>Welcome to PentestBox Tools List Website!<br>Here you will find list of the tools which are inside PentestBox and how to use them.
          <br>You can see list of tools of particular category using the left sidebar.</p>
          <p>Suppose you want to use SQLMap, you can find it's description below in Web Application Scanner Section and you will find something like given below
          <script>commandLine('sqlmap');</script>
          The console above with <strong>sqlmap</strong> in it tells that if you need to use SQLmap then <strong>sqlmap</strong> is the alias for it.
          If you are not aware with the tool and it's functions then type like <strong>sqlmap -h</strong> on console, it will display all possible functions of that tool , sqlmap in our case.</p>

          <br>I Hope you will Enjoy using PentestBox :) </p>

Many systems and network administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer (Zenmap), a flexible data transfer, redirection, and debugging tool (Ncat), a utility for comparing scan results (Ndiff), and a packet generation and response analysis tool (Nping).

Once a match is found, the plaintext is found. If all possible plaintexts are tested and no match is found, the plaintext is not found. With this type of hash cracking, all intermediate computation results are discarded.

  <a href="https://digi.ninja/projects/wifi_honey.php" target="_blank">Wifi Honey</a> - This script creates five monitor mode interfaces, four are used as APs and the fifth is used for airodump-ng. To make things easier, rather than having five windows all this is done in a screen session which allows you to switch between screens to see what is going on. All sessions are labelled so you know which is which.
