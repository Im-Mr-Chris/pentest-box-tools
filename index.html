        <p>Welcome to PentestBox Tools List Website!<br>Here you will find list of the tools which are inside PentestBox and how to use them.
          <br>You can see list of tools of particular category using the left sidebar.</p>
          <p>Suppose you want to use SQLMap, you can find it's description below in Web Application Scanner Section and you will find something like given below
          <script>commandLine('sqlmap');</script>
          The console above with <strong>sqlmap</strong> in it tells that if you need to use SQLmap then <strong>sqlmap</strong> is the alias for it.
          If you are not aware with the tool and it's functions then type like <strong>sqlmap -h</strong> on console, it will display all possible functions of that tool , sqlmap in our case.</p>
          <p>To keep everything in short, below are only aliases of the respective tool.
          <br>I Hope you will Enjoy using PentestBox :) </p>
          <p>View our Demo video below to know more about usage of PentestBox. To view in HD please watch <a href="https://vimeo.com/129652053" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

Many systems and network administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer (Zenmap), a flexible data transfer, redirection, and debugging tool (Ncat), a utility for comparing scan results (Ndiff), and a packet generation and response analysis tool (Nping).

Some of the magic behind SubBrute is that it uses open resolvers as a kind of proxy to circumvent DNS rate-limiting. This design also provides a layer of anonymity, as SubBrute does not send traffic directly to the target's name servers.

Once a match is found, the plaintext is found. If all possible plaintexts are tested and no match is found, the plaintext is not found. With this type of hash cracking, all intermediate computation results are discarded.

  <a href="https://github.com/simsong/bulk_extractor" target="_blank">Bulk Extractor</a> - bulk_extractor is a computer forensics tool that scans a disk image, a file, or a directory of files and extracts useful information without parsing the file system or file system structures. The results can be easily inspected, parsed, or processed with automated tools. bulk_extractor also created a histograms of features that it finds, as features that are more common tend to be more important. The program can be used for law enforcement, defense, intelligence, and cyber-investigation applications.

<a id="text-editors" class="anchor" href="#text-editors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Text Editors</h2>
<p>To make PenetestBox more awesome, i have added <a href="https://atom.io" target="_blank">Atom</a> and <a href="http://www.vim.org/about.php" target="_blank">vim</a> as text editors. After opening atom it will spilt up the screen with Atom on one side and your terminal on the other side, while vim runs on the same tab. Atom splitting is done to make reporting much more easier by giving access to console and editor on same screen.</p>
